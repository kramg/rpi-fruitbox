General

Fruitbox uses Allegro to output both music and sound effects.  Allegro in turn uses the default sound device 
unless told otherwise.  One of the places this can be done is in a file called allegro.cfg.  it is unclear, 
to me at least, whether you can assign more than once sound device, and if so whether you can specify, per 
sound, which device should be used.  You can prioritise sounds so there is some degree of configurability.

Process

Build a test program in stages then, if succesful, incorporate the salient bits back into fruitbox.

Roadmap for the test program is as follows:

  1. Create program using FB Allegro build which can output to the default audio device;
  2. modify so that the audio device is designated at run time in the allegro configuration file;
  3. designate two sound devices; and
  4. switch between the two designated sound devices
  
Roadmap for incorporation into fruitbox TBD.
